# Boa Vida Fish Forecast

&gt; Because asking "where should we fish?" shouldn't require a PhD in marine biology.

## What It Does

This app turns 30+ years of fishing trips into actual useful advice. Think of it as your fishing buddy who never forgets where you caught that monster sailfish.

- **Where should I fish?** (without wasting fuel)
- **What bait should I use?** (spoiler: the fish have opinions)
- **When should I go?** (because timing is everything)
- **What conditions are ideal?** (moon magic and tide wisdom)

Works on your phone. Even when the internet doesn't.

## Features

### Smart Recommendations
- Pick a fish, get actual advice (not fortune cookie wisdom)
- Find out which spots actually work (instead of "maybe try over there?")
- Learn which baits the fish prefer (they're picky eaters)
- Discover optimal fishing times (fish have schedules too)
- Get everything in one summary (because reading is hard on a boat)
