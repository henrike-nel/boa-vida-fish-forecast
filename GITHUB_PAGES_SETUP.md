3. Scroll down to **Pages** (left sidebar)
4. Under **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**
5. Choose **main** branch and **/ (root)** folder
6. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Wait for Deployment
- GitHub will build and deploy your site automatically
- This takes 1-5 minutes
- You'll see a green checkmark when it's ready

### Step 3: Access Your App
Your app will be available at: **https://henrike-nel.github.io/boa-vida-fish-forecast/**

## That's It! 🎣

**If the site shows a blank page:**

**To update the app:**
1. Make changes to `index.html` or the CSV file
2. `git add .`
3. `git commit -m "Update fishing data"`
4. `git push origin main`
